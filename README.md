## Features

  - **Spiral Out** - Generates from center outward (best for exploration)
  - **Spiral In** - Generates from edges inward
  - **Concentric Rings** - Generates in square rings around center
  - **Original** - Line-based pattern (fastest, less uniform)
  - **Random** - Random order within radius
- **Voxy Integration**: Automatically sends generated chunks to Voxy for LOD processing
- **Configurable Distances**: Set generation radius around players and spawn separately
